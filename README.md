# ngkeep
notes taking app with relations

currently available as [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ngkeep&hl=en) only, iOS app is coming soon.


This app is very lightweight, and I'm not actively working on it until I can see enough interest from potential users. Patches and bug fixes are welcome.

# motivation

Have a mindmap like experience, but focus on detailed notes, not short titles

The original idea was to create [notegraph.com](http://notegraph.com/) web and mobile apps, but this app is the only released version.
